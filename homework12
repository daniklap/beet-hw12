Beet Sprout â€” dive deeper into practice.
Estimate how long it will take to complete the test cases from the previous task. Use at least 2 techniques for evaluation (e.g. WBC and three-point estimate).
Using the WBC estimation technique, to execute the testing of the 3 test cases listed above: 
Test Case 1: Title: Load the name of the news organization
Task
Estimated time to complete task
Install mobile app on mobile device
1 minute
Click or Tap on the Mobile App, wait until it loads
2 seconds
Find the name and logo of the news organization on its website
10 seconds
Compare the name-logo of the news organization to the one got displayed on the mobile app
5 seconds
Total time estimated: 
1 minute 17 seconds

Test Case 2: Title: Load the full title of the article
Task
Estimated time to complete task
Click or Tap on the Mobile App, wait until it loads
2 seconds
Take visual note of the full article title
10 seconds
Find this article on the web
30 seconds
Compare the news article title between the app and the website
30 seconds
Total time estimated: 
1 minute 12 seconds

Test Case 3: Title: Load full content of the article
Task
Estimated time to complete task
Click or Tap on the Mobile App, wait until it loads
2 seconds
Click or Tap on the Article name
2 seconds
Open the known source of the articles such as from a website of the news organization
30 seconds
Compare the content of the article between the Mobile App and the website 
Depending upon the length of the article, this could take 5-10 minutes
Total time estimated: 
5.5 minutes to 10.5 minutes

Using the three-point estimation technique, to execute the testing of the 3 test cases listed above:
Test Case 1: Title: Load the name of the news organization
Estimate name
Estimated time to complete task
Optimistic
1 minute
Realistic
2 minutes
Pessimistic
3.5 minutes
E = (a + m + b) / 3
(1 + 2 + 3.5) / 3 = 2.2
Total time estimated: 
2.2 minutes

Test Case 2: Title: Load the full title of the article
Estimate name
Estimated time to complete task
Optimistic
2 minute
Realistic
3 minutes
Pessimistic
5 minutes
E = (a + m + b) / 3
(2 + 3 + 5) / 3 = 3.3
Total time estimated: 
3.3 minutes

Test Case 3: Title: Load full content of the article
Estimate name
Estimated time to complete task
Optimistic
5 minute
Realistic
7 minutes
Pessimistic
10 minutes
E = (a + m + b) / 3
(5 + 7 + 10) / 3 = 7.3
Total time estimated: 
7.3 minutes



Hi Daniel, Below is my feedback: Beet Seed: Good job with the high and low level test cases. Beet Sprout: Good job with the estimations as well. One remark â€“ in the real world nobody does estimations in seconds or minutes, only in hours or/and days ðŸ˜Š However, good use of the 2 approaches.

Mighty Beet: get an all-round topics coverage by completing level three of the home assignment:
We keep on working on a startup for a cat photo sharing app. The testing team is growing along with the product. You are thinking about creating a test strategy. Try to create a document that would meet the needs of your team (template attached).
